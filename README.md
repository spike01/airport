Airport
=======

Makers Academy week 3 OOP challenge
-----------------------------------

__Objective__: Given a [spec file governing a very basic control flow](https://gist.github.com/ecomba/2fb61ab115080599f8d8) for a very simplified airport and bunch of planes... make it work!

Instructions
-----------

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/spike01/airport.git
$ rspec
```

If everything has gone to plan, all the tests will pass. 

If you happen to want to play with everything in a REPL, then a convenient quickload is offered by running `require './load'` in your REPL of choice.
